A Kinder macOS Update

*********************************************
A workflow for more user intuitive macOS updates.  Allowing the user to defer updates to 
a move convenient time after updates become available, while allowing for greater assurance
that security updates are being applied to IT.
*********************************************

This script is designed to be used with Jamf pro, a Self-Service policy, and a local 
launchd agent to ensure updates are checked for daily.  It is provided without warranty  

**Requirements:

   •Jamf Pro
   •a logged in user
   •MacOS Clients 10.13 or later (testing prior to 10.13.4 has not been performed)
   •	Composer

**Why I built this:

Jamf, at the time of this writing, did not have a good deferral process for 
Apple OS updates in my opinion.  Not only had apple introduced a new reboot state 
into their reboot flavors after update that Jamf had not integrated yet, but 
Jamf's deferrals only allowed a user to defer up to a date, and next moth I would 
be forced to go out and set up a new deferral date.  These scripts work as 2 
halves to a solution. The deferral script runs locally on a daily basis thanks to
a launchd daemon.  The deferral script checks if there are any updates and, if updates
are found, it nags the user to allow the updates to be installed.  As any IT person
can attest though, there needs to be some teeth and the deferral script allows for
only a set number of deferrals before enforcing the updates anyways via triggering
a Jamf policy.

**Configuring the process:

1. Pick a place to store the Deferral script
   a. I choose /Library/Application Support/MyOrgName, but you can pick anywhere that launchd can reach.
2. Pick a place to store the logs for both the Deferral script and the Update script.
   a. I choose /Library/Log/MyOrgName, but as long as it is a permanent location that you can remember
   to look back to when/if something goes wrong then it should work for you.
3. Pick/make an icon to be used by the hud windows.
4. Pick a custom trigger name to input into your deferral script. (I used AppleUpdateScript)
5. Edit both scripts’ variables section to record your homes for the above. (Logs, Deferral script location, icon location).  Also edit the daemon plist with the location of the deferral script and the time you want the deferral script to fire off daily.
6. Package the plist, deferral script, and new log folder up all pretty in Composer.  
   You will need to add a postinstall bash script in composer to load the launchd daemon.  
   Example one liner below: 
 
   sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.YourOrg.SoftwareUpdate.plist

7. Upload your edited SoftwareUpdate4.sh script to Jamf
8. Create 2 policies in Jamf.
   a. Script execution policy visible in Self-Service.
      i. This policy will execute the SoftwareUpdate4.sh script.
      ii. It should have a custom trigger that is input into your deferral script
      iii. Make sure this policy can be trigger from Self-Service.  Allowing it to 
           be executed from self-service will allow users to start the updates whenever
           they want (aka when it is more convenient), not just when the nag annoys 
           them mid-morning.
   b. A policy to push and install the .pkg you packaged earlier in composer.
      i. This policy should be set to run once per computer at check-in.

**Stuff I am still working on:
   •Getting the script templatized correctly to accept config changes from a profile 
    distribution from Jamf.  The deferral script is almost there, AppleUpdate4 is not.
   •Bug testing
